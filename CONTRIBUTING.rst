Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `waterpy` for local development.

1. Fork the `waterpy` repo.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone <remote url to your forked version of waterpy>

3. Install your local copy into a virtual environment using virtualenv_ or conda_.
If you have virtualenvwrapper_ installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv waterpy
    $ cd waterpy/
    $ python setup.py develop

If you have conda_ installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development on Linux or Mac OS X::

    $ conda create --name waterpy
    $ source activate waterpy
    $ cd <your-path-to-waterpy-project/
    $ python setup.py develop

If you have conda_ installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development on Windows::

    > conda create --name waterpy
    > activate waterpy
    > cd <your-path-to-waterpy-project/
    > python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8_ and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox_::

    $ flake8 waterpy tests
    $ py.test
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to the respective online repository where waterpy is hosted::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the respective online repository website where waterpy is hosted.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ py.test tests/test_<your-awesome-module>.py
